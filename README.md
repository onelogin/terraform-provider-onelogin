Provider Installation
------

In order to provision 'onelogin' Terraform resources, you need to first install the 'onelogin' Terraform plugin by runningÂ the following command (you must be running Terraform >= 0.12):

```shell
export PROVIDER_NAME=onelogin && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/master/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --provider-name $PROVIDER_NAME
```

```shell
[INFO] Downloading https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/v3/releases/download/v3.0.0/terraform-provider-openapi_3.0.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz in temporally folder /var/folders/n_/1lrwb99s7f50xmn9jpmfnddh0000gp/T/tmp.Xv1AkIZh...  
[INFO] Extracting terraform-provider-openapi from terraform-provider-openapi_0.29.4_darwin_amd64.tar.gz...  
[INFO] Cleaning up tmp dir created for installation purposes: /var/folders/n_/1lrwb99s7f50xmn9jpmfnddh0000gp/T/tmp.Xv1AkIZh  
[INFO] Terraform provider 'terraform-provider-onelogin' successfully installed at: '~/.terraform.d/plugins'!
```

You can then start running the Terraform provider:

```shell
 export OTF_VAR_onelogin_PLUGIN_CONFIGURATION_FILE="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onelogin/terraform-provider-onelogin/develop/swag-api.yml" && terraform init && terraform plan
```

**Note:** As of Terraform >= 0.13 each Terraform module must declare which providers it requires, so that Terraform can install and use them. If you are using Terraform >= 0.13, copy into your .tf file the following snippet already populated with the provider configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers { 
  onelogin = {
    source  = "onelogin/onelogin"
    version = ">= 2.0.1" 
    }
  }
}
```
Until Onelogin has a signed plugin it is advised to use a signed fork such as: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Jmfwolf/onelogin/latest
which would instead be: 
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers { 
  onelogin = {
    source  = "jmfwolf/onelogin"
    version = ">= 2.0.1" 
    }
  }
}
```
## Provider Configuration

#### Example Usage

```hcl
provider "onelogin" {
  content_type = "..."
}
```

## Data Sources (using filters)

### onelogin\_api\_authorizations (filters)

The api\_authorizations data source allows you to retrieve an already existing api\_authorizations resource using filters. Refer to the arguments section to learn more about how to configure the filters.

#### Example usage

```hcl
data "onelogin_api_authorizations" "my_api_authorizations"{
    filter  {  
        name = "property name to filter by, see docs below for more info about available filter name options"  
        values = ["filter value"] 
    }
}
```

#### Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- filter - (Required) Object containing two properties.

- name [string]: the name should match one of the properties to filter by. The following property names are supported: description, name, id,
- values [array of string]: Values to filter by (only one value is supported at the moment).

**Note:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search, Terraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return a single result only.

#### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- description [string] - Description of what the API does.
- name [string] - Name of the API.
- id [integer] - Auth server unique ID in Onelogin
